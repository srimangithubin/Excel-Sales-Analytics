# Atliq-Sales-Analytics

In this project, I focus on crafting comprehensive reports in Excel for **AtliQ Hardware's finance and sales departments**. These reports aim to provide valuable insights that enable both teams to make informed decisions, ultimately driving business growth and enhancing their global market presence.


In the finance report, I have prepared a **Profit & Loss statement** that includes key metrics such as Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Margin (GM), and GM percentage. This report is available for a specific fiscal year, as well as for a particular month and quarter, allowing for detailed analysis and strategic planning.
In the sales report, I have developed one key reports:**Customer Performance Report** and **Market Performance Report**. These reports provide insights into customer and market performance for a specific region, division, and country, enabling the sales team to optimize their strategies and better serve their customers.

## Task Performed

1) Import the datasets in excel and perform **ETL** in **Power Query**.
2) Use power query for cleaning the datsets in which I deal with null values, wrong values, duplicate values and trimming extra spaces.
3) Build the data model inside **Power Pivot** in which established the relationship between facts and dimensions tables.
4) Create the date dimension table and fiscal year using power query **M-Language**
5) Use **Data Analysis Expression** (DAX) function like SUM, DIVIDE, RELATED, CALCULATE, SUMX, DISTINCT for calculating appropriate measure and calculated columns.
6) Learn the domain knowledge of finance and sales like **Profit & Loss Statement**.
